# 41189-Weekly-Reflections
# Week 1
What have I learnt this week?
In week 1 I have learnt what is a complex adaptive system and how humans play apart in these complex systems.

This week i learned about:
- Complex Adaptive System definition
- Humans role in complex systems
- Levels of Complexity 

What do I 'now know’ that I did not before?
I did not know there were different types of complexity levels within complex systems

What insights have I gained?
The different Levels of complexity.

What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that i have observed?
I'm not sure what my percieved strengths are as it is still the first week of the Unit.

What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I haven't encoutered any troubles as of yet, since the group have not been allocated.

What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
